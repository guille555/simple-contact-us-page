# simple-contact-us-page
A simple example of a "Contact us" page.
In this example I used only an HTML file to code the page. It includes the HTML page, the CSS (in styles tags) and JavaScript (in script tags). It's also included a normalizer CSS for resetting the browsers default styles.

The message consists of a series of fields that a person needs to fill in to send the message. Some fields are also "required", this means that those fields are obligatory.
When the message is sent, it will show a success message below the "send" button and an object with the message information will appear in the browser console.
